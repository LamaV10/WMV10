Not enough swap could lead to crashing.

Show swap:
swapon --show

Show how much is free:
free -h

Make 1G swap:
sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile

Start swap:
sudo swapon /swapfile_extend_1GB

Get swap in fstab (/etc/fstab):
/swapfile_extend_1GB       none       swap    sw        0       0

How to make swap bigger:
    Turn it off firest:
    sudo swapoff /swapfile
    
    Change size of the swapfile:
