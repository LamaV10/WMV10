Playing AC via Steam.

1. Downlaod the game 
2. Switch to Proton 5.0-10 for the game (left click > properties > compability)
3. Start the game (it's going to fail)
4. Now switch to Proton GE (i tested it on 10-4) -> if not installed, do it via protonup-qt
5. I needed to install .NET48 aswell (see steam messeges when starting it in the terminal) -> protontricks 244210 dotnet48
6. Now it should run!
